This project titled - Traffic control using Image processing is a part of my DIP Assignment. I have used MATLAB Online Editor ,so a GUI (guide) was not accessible.


Procedure to simulate this project
1. main.m ,picture_match and canny_edge as well as the3 images are stored in one folder .
2. Run main.m(main.m is calling canny_edge.m and picture_match.m)


Once the program is simulated , you will get a output message displayed on the command window.
